# 👋 Hi, we’re **MSL-Bala-JNCASR**

We are the **Molecular Simulation Lab (Prof. Balasubramanian Sundaram)** at **Chemistry and Physics of Materials Unit ( CPMU ), Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR)** — working on molecular and materials simulations using advanced computational techniques.

🌍 Based in **Bengaluru, India**  
🔬 We are devoted to the study of materials, molecular liquids, gas adsorption in porous materials, machine learned potentials, self-assembly, supramolecular polymers and biomolecules. To achieve these aims, we develop software and deploy large-scale academic freeware on High-Performance Computing Platforms to accurately model substances as realistically as possible.
